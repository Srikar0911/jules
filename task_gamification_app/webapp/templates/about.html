                    Our mission is to blend productivity with play. We believe that by adding elements of gamification—like points for completing tasks and a competitive leaderboard—we can motivate you to stay on top of your goals, whether they are for work, study, or personal projects.
                </p>
                <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">How It Works</h3>
                <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mb-4">
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Create Tasks:</strong> Add the things you need to get done.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Earn Points:</strong> Complete your tasks to earn points.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Climb the Leaderboard:</strong> See how you stack up against other users. A little friendly competition can be a great motivator.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Stay Organized:</strong> Keep all your tasks in one place, and track your progress over time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This project is built with Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy, demonstrating a clean separation between the core application logic and the web interface. It now uses Bootstrap for a clean, responsive design.
