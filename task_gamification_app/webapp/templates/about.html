        <h2>About TaskGamify</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to TaskGamify, the application designed to make your to-do list more engaging and fun!
        </p>
        <p>
            Our mission is to blend productivity with play. We believe that by adding elements of gamification—like points for completing tasks and a competitive leaderboard—we can motivate you to stay on top of your goals, whether they are for work, study, or personal projects.
        </p>
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Create Tasks:</strong> Add the things you need to get done.</li>
            <li><strong>Earn Points:</strong> Complete your tasks to earn points.</li>
            <li><strong>Climb the Leaderboard:</strong> See how you stack up against other users. A little friendly competition can be a great motivator.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Organized:</strong> Keep all your tasks in one place, and track your progress over time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This project is built with Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy, demonstrating a clean separation between the core application logic and the web interface.
